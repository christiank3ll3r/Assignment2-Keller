<h6> Basketball </h6>

I like the game because it requires hard work and **dedication.**
You have to run up and down the court, and there are few stops in play.  I love everything down to a small pass that results in points all the way up to a flashy dunk or shot.  My favorite team is the Kansas **Jayhawks.**
